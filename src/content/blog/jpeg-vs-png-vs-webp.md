## The three formats you need to know

Every image format makes trade-offs between file size, quality, and features. Understanding these trade-offs helps you pick the right format for every situation.

## JPEG — The photography standard

**Best for:** Photos, complex images with many colors, social media uploads

JPEG uses lossy compression, which means it discards some visual information to achieve smaller files. The quality loss is usually imperceptible at high quality settings (80-95%), but becomes noticeable at lower values.

**Pros:**

- Excellent compression for photographs
- Universal browser and device support
- Adjustable quality slider for size/quality trade-off

**Cons:**

- No transparency support
- Lossy — quality degrades with each re-save
- Poor for text, diagrams, or sharp edges

**When to use:** Photographs, hero images, social media posts, any image where small artifacts won't be noticed.

## PNG — The quality keeper

**Best for:** Screenshots, logos, diagrams, images with transparency

PNG uses lossless compression — every pixel is preserved exactly. This makes it perfect for images where accuracy matters, but results in larger file sizes for photographs.

**Pros:**

- Lossless — no quality degradation
- Full transparency (alpha channel) support
- Sharp edges and text preserved perfectly

**Cons:**

- Much larger file sizes for photos
- No quality slider (always lossless)
- Overkill for photographs

**When to use:** Screenshots, logos, icons, UI elements, any image requiring transparency or pixel-perfect reproduction.

## WebP — The modern choice

**Best for:** Web content where both quality and file size matter

WebP was developed by Google as a modern replacement for both JPEG and PNG. It supports both lossy and lossless compression, plus transparency — the best of both worlds.

**Pros:**

- 25-35% smaller than equivalent JPEG at similar quality
- Supports both lossy and lossless modes
- Transparency support (unlike JPEG)
- Excellent browser support (97%+ globally)

**Cons:**

- Slightly less universal than JPEG/PNG in non-web contexts
- Some older image editors don't support it
- Encoding can be slower than JPEG

**When to use:** Any web content — it's almost always the best choice for websites. Use for both photos and graphics.

## Quick decision guide

| Scenario                | Format      | Why                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| Photo for a website     | WebP        | Smallest size with great quality |
| Photo for email/sharing | JPEG        | Maximum compatibility            |
| Screenshot              | PNG         | Lossless, sharp text             |
| Logo with transparency  | PNG or WebP | Both support alpha channels      |
| Icon or UI graphic      | PNG         | Pixel-perfect at small sizes     |
| Batch web optimization  | WebP        | Best size-to-quality ratio       |

## How to convert between formats

With Reshrimp, converting is simple: upload your image, select the target format from the dropdown, and click process. The conversion happens instantly in your browser — no upload required.

You can also adjust the quality setting when converting to JPEG or WebP to find the perfect balance between file size and visual quality. The side-by-side preview lets you compare the result before downloading.
